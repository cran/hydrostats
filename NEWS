hydrostats 0.2.4
----------------------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* The high.spell.lengths function was fixed so that missing values do not result in incorrect start dates being returned (Thanks to Bastian Pöschl).

* Fixed a typo in the help for daily.cv (Thanks to Tony Ladson).

* The baseflows function now reflects the start and end values from the time-series (n.reflected) before calculating the baseflow component to reduce sensitivity to the starting conditions (as recommended by Ladson, A. R., R. Brown, B. Neal and R. Nathan (2013). “A standard approach to baseflow separation using the Lyne and Hollick filter.” Australian Journal of Water Resources 17(1): 173-180.).

* corrected year count in the baseflow function.

hydrostats 0.2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Modified a number of functions (including partial.series and baseflow) to prevent an error when used with group_by and 'do' 
	from the dplyr package (useful for analysing multiple flow series simultaneously).

* added minimum and median spell duration to the results returned by 
	the low.spells and high.spells functions.

* added number of years and ARI to the partial series output.

* fixed an error in high.spells and low.spells, which could produce an error in the duration statistics for annual series.


hydrostats 0.2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Modified the code for high.spells and low.spells to prevent an error when used with the 'do' 
	function in dplyr, which allows the use of arbitrary functions 
	with the group_by function.




hydrostats 0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fixed a bug in baseflow function that caused issues when date and 
	discharge data were in columns other than columns 1 and 2.

* added to Colwells function the ability to output a dataframe of the 
	indices only.

*	shifted the reporting of record length from high.spells to baseflows
	function so that if outputs are combined in a dataframe, record
	length is now the first variable if baseflows is the first function run.

* various corrections/edits to the manual pages.
