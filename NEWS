hydrostats 0.2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Modified a number of functions (including partial.series and baseflow) to prevent an error when used with group_by and 'do' 
	from the dplyr package (useful for analysing multiple flow series simultaneously).

* added minimum and median spell duration to the results returned by 
	the low.spells and high.spells functions.

* added number of years and ARI to the partial series output.

* fixed an error in high.spells and low.spells, which could produce an error in the duration statistics for annual series.


hydrostats 0.2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Modified the code for high.spells and low.spells to prevent an error when used with the 'do' 
	function in dplyr, which allows the use of arbitrary functions 
	with the group_by function.




hydrostats 0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fixed a bug in baseflow function that caused issues when date and 
	discharge data were in columns other than columns 1 and 2.

* added to Colwells function the ability to output a dataframe of the 
	indices only.

*	shifted the reporting of record length from high.spells to baseflows
	function so that if outputs are combined in a dataframe, record
	length is now the first variable if baseflows is the first function run.

* various corrections/edits to the manual pages.
